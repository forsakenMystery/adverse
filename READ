Introduction
  A. Nowadays we are using a lot more of computer programs, and our lives are the most affected by them. In this magnificent era for computers, we are using a fascinating concept as machine learning more each day as another. However, there has been proved they are not as precise as we thought before. There is possibility of attack.
  B. In other word you can trick them to give results wrongly. For instance, they can make mistakes and misclassify something crucial for our peaceful life which it will lead to catastrophic disasters.
  C. The way these attacks are done is simple. As we know models consist a lot of linear and nonlinear units which together can predict the hardest functions. However these aggregation will lead to something huge when you change a tiny bit of an input. For illustrating you can thing you have only linear models stacking up against each other. Now if you change non-significant value of input in a way that most people cannot recognize youâ€™ve changed the input since in your model always the weight between cells are in effect it can add up to huge change in the last output and even misclassify anything.
  D. There are two line of attacks really: n on-targeted and targeted which means you are going to decide what kind of misclassification you want to have. In other word, if you are going to choose to just get a wrong result no matter misclassification happen you are doing a non-targeted adversarial attack and if you choose to do more processing to receive a particular class for your misclassification you are doing a targeted attack.
